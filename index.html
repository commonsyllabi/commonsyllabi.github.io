        <h2>Rationale</h2>
        <p>We believe that open sharing and access brings progress. Currently, the curricula designed by educators are
            too often locked away behind the walls of proprietary software and institutional accounts. Despite the fact
            that educators typically own the IP rights to the course material they develop, there are few tools that
            specifically support <b>the open creation and distribution of learning materials between teachers</b>.
        </p>
        <p>This is especially ironic given that academia is, by and large, a field that prizes open sharing and
            collaborative progress.</p>

                <p>
                    Common Cartridge (CC) is a set of open standards developed by the IMS Global Learning Consortium
                    that
                    aims to provide a standard way to represent digital course materials..
                </p>

                <p>Common Cartridge is a format which allows for the open publication and cataloging of syllabi and
                    learning
                    materials on any compliant platform. Unfortunately, the CC format lacks any usable and
                    well-maintained
                    tools for handling the format, resulting in the siloing of teaching resources within institutional
                    learning management systems.</p>

                <p>
                    There still exists no platform on which educators can publish
                    and browse the syllabi they have created for their classes. Virtually every Learning Management
                    Systems
                    (LMS) deployed by leading education institutions do not allow for the open sharing of syllabi
                    content.
                </p>

                <p>If teachers wish to share syllabi they have authored outside of the confines of institutional LMS,
                    they
                    may
                    theoretically do so independently. Some educators resort to self-publishing their syllabi, often on
                    one-off
                    microsites. However, these sites, being highly decentralized, unstandardized and often tedious to
                    maintain,
                    are difficult to index meaningfully.

                    Classrooms are places of dynamic exchanges and conversation between students and instructors.
                </p>

                <p> Existing slideware (e.g. Google Slides, Keynote, Powerpoint, etc.), do not support on-the-fly note
                    taking or diagramming. If linked resources are used, there also arises a need to switch frequently
                    between multiple windows and applications when preparing and presenting materials.
