**We are a viewer for Common Cartridge, the open source syllabi format.**

## Background

Common Cartridge (CC) is a set of open standards developed by the IMS Global Learning Consortium that aims to provide a standard way to represent digital course materials..

Common Cartridge is a format which allows for the open publication and cataloging of syllabi and learning materials on any compliant platform. Unfortunately, the CC format lacks any usable and well-maintained tools for handling the format, resulting in the siloing of teaching resources within institutional learning management systems.

We want to prototype an open source tool that allows users to view CC syllabi, and a repository where users can share them.

These are critical components to the free sharing and discoverability of syllabi. Ultimately, our goal is to empower educators with the tools to publish, browse and archive syllabi.  Our long-term road map can be viewed on our project website.

## Rationale

We believe that open sharing and access brings progress. Currently, the curricula designed by educators are too often locked away behind the walls of proprietary software and institutional accounts. Despite the fact that educators typically own the IP rights to the course material they develop, there are few tools that specifically support the open sharing of syllabi between teachers.

Firstly, we want to address the issue that current LMS ecosystems discourage the long-standing culture of open sharing in academia, particularly when it comes to syllabi. In the spirit of the open science movement, the free circulation of academic materials benefits all, this is true of research materials, as well as for pedagogical materials.

Secondly, siloed resources hinder educators from having a macro-level visibility of their peers’ work across fields. Since many educators resort to publishing course materials on personal websites, discovering and consulting curricula developed by peers is an arduous task of navigating scattered, un-indexed resources.

Finally, delaying the adoption of open format(s) also jeopardizes the longevity of knowledge by hindering the viability of creating openly accessible repositories and/or archives.

## Audience

Our primary target group is educators who wish to openly share/publish/archive curricula materials, browse syllabi developed by others via the CC format. We plan to cater to an international user base, and will build with i18n in mind.

In the initial stages, we will rely on word of mouth within our personal networks (e.g. New York University, Filmuniversitaet Babelsberg-Konrad Wolf, TU Berlin, Sciences Po and Paris-3 Sorbonne Nouvelle), as well as organic search to grow the user base. Further into the future, when a reliably stable and secure product has been developed, we may consider more targeted outreach projects.
